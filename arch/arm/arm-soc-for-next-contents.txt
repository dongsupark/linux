From Rob Herring <robherring2@gmail.com>:

This is the 2nd part of mach/io.h removals. This series removes io.h on
platforms with PCI by creating a fixed virtual I/O mapping and a common
__io() macro.

This version has changed a bit to accommodate Tegra converting its PCIe
host to a platform driver. Now the virtual space is only reserved during
early boot before .map_io() is called. The mapping is not created until
calling pci_ioremap_io which can be done at any point after vmalloc is
initialized.

I've gone back to fixed 64K windows for each PCI bus. This allows
removing all the i/o resource setup from the individually platforms and
placing it within the common ARM PCI code.

I've only tested versatilepb under qemu (with the model hacked up to
actually enable i/o space), so any testing is appreciated. iop3xx and
mv78xx0 have some risk of breaking as the PCI bus addresses are moved
to 0 from matching the cpu host bus addesss.
